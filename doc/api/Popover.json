  "description": "An `Popover` represents a modal ui container that is shown above the apps content. It provides the root element of a new layout hierarchy in the form of its `contentView` property. User provided widgets can be attached to the `contentView` similarly to the `tabris.ui.contentView`. In order to close the `Popover` the `close()` method can be used.\n\nThe appearance of the `Popover` depends on the device size: On larger devices (like tablets) the `Popover` is shown as a floating window whereas on smaller devices it is shown as a fullscreen sheet covering the entire app. When used on larger devices, the size _has_ to be provided via the `width` and `height` properties.",
